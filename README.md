# Breakout

This is a very simple project using THREE.js. Consists in a simple version of the Breakout game.

## Setup

You will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) in order to run this project.

  ```
  npm install
  npm start
  ```

Then open http://localhost:5000.

## Playing

In order to play, you just need to left click with your mouse and adjust the paddle acceleration accordingly to the cursor position. Left click also pause/unpause the game. Right click also pause and pressing it allows the game to play only one frame per click. You can reset the game at any time with the "r" key. 

## Next steps

As this was originally intended as an assignment project, it's still very raw and there are many things that can be done, such as:
- [ ] Create the code docs
- [ ] Allow the game to be played fullscreen
- [ ] Adapt the game window to the browser
- [ ] Create a level system
- [ ] Allow the ball to accelerate accordingly to the angle that it hits the paddle
- [ ] Change the way that the cursor controls the paddle. It was originally using cursor position to accelerate just to put some concepts in practice
